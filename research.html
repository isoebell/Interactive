  <h1>here is what has influenced me</h1>

  <div class="pagedescriptor">
    <p> There is definitely commonality across these influences, most commonly its their design approaches and the exploration of type. I definitely want to develop on my interactive coding skills to create more p5.js sketches that are more creative than my circle drawing code or go beyond using pre-established snake game code and editing the styling.</p>
    <P> Before I started 2B, I was quite the visionary. Hoping that I would create a website that needed the user to enter 'a secret' to be allowed into the website, and once they entered there would be a moving graphic that is a visual representation of that secret. This was easier said than done, and I realised that my main focus should be to work on the website's wireframe and actual user experience. So, for now we have a user friendly website, that has the potential to hold some more creative and interactive code. This also explains why so much of my research and inspiration is focused on visual layout and website design. The more complicated p5.js sketch inspiration sit in here as a goal, I don't feel like my website reflects the skill shown in many of those sketches, but, I can dream. </P>

            Jackie Liiu's CodeWords project, Oscillate, is illustrative of a super fun and simple interactive p5.js sketch. I absolutely love the yellow and the typeface, those definitely drew me in. But the extra secret text elements that slowly revealed themselves as you interacted with the sketch were so cool, and I want to learn how to do that.

            I have no clue how to find the hidden words, or even if there are words hidden that can be found in Fergus Arundel's CodeWords project, Cells, regardless, I find the design and the interaction between the 'cells' themselves and the design and the user incredibly creative. The movement it encapuslates is something I hope to figure out.

            The Big Issue's website is super simple, clean, and user friendly. I think that their online presence is super palatable and easy to navigate. I specifically like the section, pictured above, due to their grid system and use of colours. Grid systems were definitely developed after seeing this website.

            Talilah's design layout is so visually appealing. I love its simplicity and user friendly design, I most definitley inspected her code to help me build upon my grid systems (well, my attempt at grid systems). Reading code by someone of a similar skill level truly helped me understand how to build my website better.

            Kristine Gudmundsen's CodeWords project was such an interesting approach to 'revealing' type. It's such an easy interface to use, I hadn't had such a smooth experience moving through a multi-dimensional web-space merely with my trackpad.
