    <h1>the 'try new things' game</h1>

    <div class="pagedescriptor"> 
     <p>A game that you play outside of your computer. Play with others if you can. </p>
     <p>Here is the visual representation of my day rolling the die and trying new things.</p>
     <p>I wore something typical, I had my usual breakfast, I caught the tram (as per usual), I had to listen to something 'different' so I played a 'happy mix for you' (I prefer listening to albums or my own curated playlists), I ate a different lunch, sat in a different spot in class, I even rolled the die to help my tutor decide on their own lunch. Kilian and I even used the die to dictate the way we walked to and from our classes.</p>
     <p>Essentially, if I rolled an odd number I tried something new, an even number I could pick what was most comfortable or most routine. At first I was annoyed that I wasn't being pushed to try new things, so I tried going against it and putting on a new outfit (I hated it so I changed). But I liked that it was making me question my own comfortability, rather, predictability.</p>
