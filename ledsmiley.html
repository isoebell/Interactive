    <h1>LED SMILEY <em>(also, LED matrix)</em></h1>

    <div class="pagedescriptor"> 
     <p>Potentially the most fun and silly activity thus far, but also so easily transferable to the day to day, the beginning steps to creating a touch sensitive lamp etc. Also really cool to understand how some people play music through fruit on the streets etc, I used to think it was a well timed bit, however now I understand they actually made music with touch and fruit.
        We obviously needed our Arduino friend, breadboard, wires, and a few varying resistors (1ko and 10m), and then whatever fruit or object you want to influence the computing. We chose a banana, so fun. At first we were unsure why it wasn't working, then we realised the pre-established threshold was too high, it was set to 1100, whereas when we made contact with the banana the highest reading we were getting was about 700, so we reduced the threshold and then we had light, <em>so fun</em>.</p>
        Don't forget to reset, and upload your code to the Arduino using Arduino Uno specfically.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The code for this one is so long, and complicated that my usual 'textarea placeholder' technique doesn't work to insert all the code, so, like previously, I have a screenshot of this code.</p>
